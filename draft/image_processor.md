# AI Modeling Interference Service Spec
Here is the spec:
- The API Service will accept image raw bytes
- The API will feed the image data to huggingface “fffiloni/CLIP-Interrogator-2” model to extract text from image
- The API will return the texts to the API caller
  Create the python api service. 

# Response (3.5)

Sure! Here's an example implementation of the API service using Flask and the huggingface `CLIP-Interrogator-2` model:

```python
import io
import json

from PIL import Image
from flask import Flask, request, jsonify
from transformers import CLIPProcessor, CLIPModel


app = Flask(__name__)

# Load the CLIP model and processor
model = CLIPModel.from_pretrained("fffiloni/CLIP-Interrogator-2")
processor = CLIPProcessor.from_pretrained("fffiloni/CLIP-Interrogator-2")

# Define the API endpoint
@app.route('/extract_text', methods=['POST'])
def extract_text():
    # Get the image data from the request body
    image_data = request.get_data()

    # Convert the image data to a PIL image
    image = Image.open(io.BytesIO(image_data))

    # Preprocess the image for the CLIP model
    inputs = processor(image, return_tensors="pt", padding=True)

    # Pass the image through the CLIP model
    outputs = model(**inputs)

    # Get the text embeddings from the CLIP model
    text_embeddings = outputs.last_hidden_state[:, 0, :]

    #Decode the text embeddings to get the corresponding text
    text = processor.decode(text_embeddings)

    # Return the extracted text as a JSON response
    return jsonify({'text': text})
```

This API endpoint accepts a POST request with image data in the request body. It converts the image data to a PIL image, preprocesses it for the CLIP model using the `CLIPProcessor`, passes it through the `CLIPModel`, and finally decodes the text embeddings to get the corresponding text. The extracted text is returned as a JSON response.

Note that this implementation assumes that the input image contains text. If the input image does not contain text, the extracted text may not be accurate. You may need to modify this implementation to handle non-text images appropriately.
